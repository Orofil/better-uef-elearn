# "Better" UEF eLearn
A CSS customization of the [UEF eLearn](https://elearn.uef.fi/) site using [UserCSS](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus/wiki/UserCSS) and the [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus) browser extension.

This being better than the unmodified site is subjective, but I hope you can request changes that would make this better.

## Installation
Install [Stylus](https://github.com/openstyles/stylus#releases) and then open [this](https://github.com/Orofil/better-uef-elearn/raw/main/elearn.user.css) and install.
